# Docker

This repo documents my understanding of Docker. The structure of my notes are as follows, and more details on each topic is presented in the Markdown files, named consistently with the first-level headings below, attached to this repo.

## 1. Introduction

### What is Docker:

Docker is a platform for **building, running, and shipping pplications** in a **consistent manner**. It solves the problem of "my application works on my machine though!:)". The three reasons behind this problem could be:

+ one or more files missing (your application is not completely deployed and misses something)
+ software version mismatch 
+ different configuration settings like different environemnt variables across different machines 

Docker comes to rescue to solve the above issues.
