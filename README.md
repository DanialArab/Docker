# Docker

This repo documents my understanding of Docker. The structure of my notes are as follows, and more details on each topic is presented in the Markdown files, named consistently with the first-level headings below, attached to this repo.

## 1. Introduction

### What is Docker:

Docker is a platform for **building, running, and shipping pplications** in a **consistent manner**. It solves the problem of "my application works on my machine though!:)". The three reasons behind this problem could be:

+ one or more files missing (your application is not completely deployed and misses something)
+ software version mismatch 
+ different configuration settings like different environemnt variables across different machines 

Docker comes to rescue to solve the above issues. 
 
### Virtual machines vs. Containers

A container is an isolated environment for running an application. 

Virtual machine is an abstraction of a machine (physical hardware) and we can run several virtual machines on a real physical machine. We achive tghis using a tool called **hypervisor**. In a simple term, a hypervisor is a software we use to create and manage virtual machines. There are many hypervisors out there like:

+ VirtualBox
+ VMware
+ Hyper-v (Wondows only)

Benefits of building a virtual machines is we can run an application in isolation.

The problems of using virtual machines:

+ each VM needs a **full-blown OS**, that needs to be licensed, patched, and monitored 
+ slow to start, because the entire OS has to be loaded just like starting your computer 
+ resource intensive, because each VM takes a slice of actual physical hardware resources like CPU, Memory and disk space

So due to the above issues we h+may have limited number of VMs on our machine. 

Containes compatred to VMs:

+ give us the same kind of isolation so we can run multiple applications in isolation
+ they are more lightweight compared to VMs and so do not need the full OS
+ all the containers on a machine use OS of the host, meaning all the containers share the OS of the host (more accurately, they share the kernel (the core or the engine) of the host OS) so we only need to license, patch, and monitor a single OS of the host
+ start quickly usually in seconds sometimes less
+ need less hardware resources on the host 

so due to the above benefits we can run even 100s of containers on a single machine side by side.

### Docker architecture

Docker uses a client-server architecture. So it has a client component that talks to a server component using a REST API. The server, also called docker engine, sits in the background and takes care of building and running docker containers.
